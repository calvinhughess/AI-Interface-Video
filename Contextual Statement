In making the video "I asked ChatGPT to play Rocket League (and it worked)", I really wanted to merge the 
excitement of a catchy, sensational title with the real-world application of AI in gaming. I chose a 
title that would stand out on YouTube and grab people's attention, hoping to then lead them into a more 
detailed conversation about what AI can and can't do in a game like Rocket League.

This video was a way for me to show off both my technical skills in AI and programming, and my ability 
to engage an audience. I balanced the exaggerated portrayal of ChatGPT's role with the actual technical 
details of creating an AI-controlled Rocket League interface. Although the video focuses more on the 
sensational aspect, the real work behind it involved a lot of coding and problem-solving, and that’s a 
big part of my professional story.

By including this video in my portfolio, I'm trying to show that I'm not just about coding; I can also 
create content that's interesting and accessible to a wider audience. I think it’s important to not only 
be good at the technical side of things but also to know how to make it interesting and understandable for 
everyone. This video is a piece of that – it’s about being a developer, but also about being a storyteller 
and someone who can make complex tech stuff fun and engaging.
